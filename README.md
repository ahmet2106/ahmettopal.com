# Ahmet Topal

> Started coding without internet, built things people actually used, won by executing fast, and turned one small decision into a career - still building, still learning.

This is my personal blog.

I write about building digital products, automation, AI-assisted workflows, and the lessons learned from shipping real things over many years.
