Wow am I creative starting my blog with the first post titled "Hello World!". But didn't coding teach us to do so?

I wrote a lot [about me](/about) today and I don't want to copy paste everything (even if this is a routine as a developer as well).

### Let me summarize

My name is Ahmet, born and grown in Germany, started coding at 12 by reading a 1€ book bought by my sister. And no, this is not my first blog. I've been blogging since 2007 but shut down after I built my [agency](https://federlight.com) in 2013.

I love to build stuff in different languages including PHP, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Swift and many more (depends on the project). Today AI helps me to be faster in coding by me being more the one reviewing and evaluating the output.

Who really got me back into blogging was [@steipete](https://x.com/steipete) who slid into my timeline on X the last weeks. I was inspired by OpenClaw and the community. And I know that coding is a lot about inspiration.

That's exactly what this blog is about: To share my thoughts, projects, my learnings and experiences, inspire and motivate others.

Learn more [about me](/about) and if you made it this far:  
Say `👋🏼 Hi` on [X / Twitter](https://x.com/ahmettopal).
